       Insecurities, What are They?
    </h2>

	  <p>The term insecurities refers to the uncertainty one may have about one's abilities, choices, or capabilities. Insecurities are the negative thoughts, beliefs and emotions associated with one's self-concept. They are typically based on the individual's past experiences, thoughts, memories and rationalizations. They may also be related to any number of things that might have happened in a person's life including the death of a loved one, divorce, abuse or problems with school or work. The individual may believe that these things are permanent and will never change. Thus, fear results from this fear that "they will never change" and/or "this is how I am meant to be".</p><br>
    
    <h3>Body Image Insecurity</h3>
    <p>Physical appearance or body image insecurity refers to a holding in which the individual is constantly thinking of how they look. It can cause those with such insecurity to avoid social activities, thereby limiting their family and friends from having healthy relationships. It could also lead an individual to be depressed and anxious as well as have low self-esteem. Physical appearance or body image insecurity is often caused by what others say about one's physical appearance or how one feels about themselves.
</p><br>
    
    <h3>Social Life Insecurity</h3>
    <p>Social life or social standing insecurity is the fear of change in one's social position. This could take many forms such as being concerned about losing status, losing friendships and relationships, and even being concerned about poverty. This insecurity comes from a combination of the fear that one's social position might change and the fear that others' social positions will improve. This may be due, in part, to negative thoughts and beliefs about oneself and negative interaction with others. Social life insecurity may also be caused by the thought that one's standing is based on a limited number of possessions or characteristics (e.g., "I'm not good enough") rather than effort which could lead to feelings of inferiority and helplessness.</p><br>
    
    <h3>Relationship Insecurity</h3>
    <p>Relationship insecurity is related to how someone feels about their relationship with others. They may feel insecure if they think they are not liked or accepted by the other person, or if they think the other person might leave them. It can also include feeling like you don’t have as much in common with someone compared to another. This may lead to a cycle of disengagement and withdrawal. Insecurity in relationships is not exclusive to romantic relationships only. It includes mother-daughter or son relationships, father-son or daughter, friendships, etc.</p><br>

    <p>There are a lot of other insecurities out there. Insecurities are not limited to those that have been mentioned here. Nonetheless, one should always know that they are special, lovable, and enough.</p>
