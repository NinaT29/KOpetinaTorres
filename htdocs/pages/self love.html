	  <h2>
       A Proper Relationship With One's Self
    </h2>

	  <p>In order to build a proper and healthy relationship with yourself, you must learn about self-love. Self-love is the act of accepting oneself with joy. Self-love is important as it helps with self-esteem. One can grow and develop themselves through their own self-love. It also leads to one's happiness in realizing their own significance in the world. Self-love also teaches one how to be more kind to others by treating themselves well and not negatively judging themselves or others, which leads to becoming more compassionate towards those around us. It also lowers stress levels, which can decrease a person's physical health problems and mental health problems including depression and anxiety.</p><br>
    
    <h3>Be Kind and True to Yourself</h3>

    <p> Self love and acceptance takes time and patience to practice. It comes hand-in-hand with confidence, and being confident boosts our overall mood and makes us feel good. It is essential that we take care of ourselves physically and mentally, and we can do this by setting healthy boundaries, taking breaks from things that drain us, prioritizing ourselves first, listening to our bodies’ needs, moving/stretching/exercising, distancing ourselves from our phones and social media for periods of time, doing hobbies we love, eating healthily, rewarding ourselves, and most importantly, to forgive ourselves. We must make room for healthy habits and drop those that have negative impacts on us, such as comparing ourselves to others and dwelling on past mistakes. Let us all learn to replace self pity with self love.
 </p><br>

    <h3>Things to Avoid</h3>

    <p>We can start practicing self love by overcoming unhealthy habits. These include, but are not limited to, poor sleep, not eating enough and on time, neglecting hygiene, being disorganized, regret, overuse of devices, overthinking, failure mindset, lack of exercise, regret, and guilt. In order to become at peace with ourselves, we must learn to know what is best for us and accepting that just because we are “imperfect”, does not mean that we do not deserve to be loved and taken care of.</p><br>
